#2) Write a program to perform different Arithmetic Operations on numbers in Python

a=int(input("Enter A value : "))
b=int(input("Enter B value : "))
print('-'*50,"\nArithmetic Operations on A & B Values.")
print("Addition of ",a," & ",b," is : ",a+b)
print("Subtraction of ",a," & ",b," is : ",a-b)
print("Multiplication of ",a," & ",b," is : ",a*b)
print("Division of ",a," & ",b," is : ",a/b)
print("Remainder of ",a," & ",b," is : ",a%b)
print("Exponent (power of ) ",a," & ",b," is : ",a**b)
print('-'*50)
